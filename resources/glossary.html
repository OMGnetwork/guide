Therefore, it can be seen as an electronic form of cash. Four key components of a blockchain: assets, ledger, witnesses and actors.</p> <h3 id="cash-in-and-cash-out-touch-points"><a href="#cash-in-and-cash-out-touch-points" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cash-in and cash-out touch points</h3> <p>A place where users can deposit or withdraw their asset value or cash (e.g. banking, hardware, retail partners)</p> <h3 id="clearinghouse"><a href="#clearinghouse" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Clearinghouse</h3> <p>Financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange (i.e., clearance) of payments, securities, or derivatives transactions.</p> <h3 id="currency-agnostic-asset-transfer"><a href="#currency-agnostic-asset-transfer" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Currency-agnostic asset transfer</h3> <p>The ability to transfer currencies in an interoperable network, that means, multiple currencies and tokens can be exchanged and swapped within the same network, without having to leave the network. The network is not limited to one single currency.</p> <h3 id="ethereum"><a href="#ethereum" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ethereum</h3> <p>Open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.[3] It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.</p> <h3 id="ether-eth"><a href="#ether-eth" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ether (ETH)</h3> <p>The primary internal cryptographic token of the Ethereum network. Ether can be used to pay transaction and computation fees for Ethereum transactions.</p> <h3 id="erc20"><a href="#erc20" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> ERC20</h3> <p>Technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. The clear majority of tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain are ERC-20 compliant.</p> <h3 id="fees-or-transaction-fee"><a href="#fees-or-transaction-fee" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fees (or transaction fee)</h3> <p>Serve as an incentive to validators to enforce consensus across the network</p> <h3 id="omg-token"><a href="#omg-token" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> OMG token</h3> <p>First and foremost a staking token. By holding OMG tokens, users gain the right to take an active role by running validator nodes on OMG's Proof of Stake network, using their tokens as a security deposit. Returns may be paid out in any currency, including but not limited to OMG.</p> <h3 id="off-chain"><a href="#off-chain" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Off-Chain</h3> <p>Off-chain transactions are transactions that are handled outside of the root blockchain using methods such as Plasma or Lightning Network. Transactions off-chain are usually instantaneous, because they don't need to wait for the root chain network validation. They are usually also a lot cheaper. Off-chain transactions are to be secured by the root chain.</p> <h3 id="on-chain"><a href="#on-chain" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> On-Chain</h3> <p>On-chain transactions are transactions that alter the state of the root blockchain. The transactions is recorded on a block and then dispersed to the entire blockchain network. They may take longer than off-chain transactions because the validation needs to happen on the root blockchain network, which has often a limited number of transactions per second. Also it can come with a higher transaction cost.</p> <h3 id="penalty"><a href="#penalty" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Penalty</h3> <p>A penalty in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) can take the form of either hard slashing (loss of all staked tokens) or soft slashing (loss of returns)</p> <h3 id="plasma"><a href="#plasma" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma</h3> <p>Plasma is a framework for building scalable applications. It is a way of building scalable decentralized applications that don’t sacrifice security for speed.</p> <h3 id="point-of-sales-pos"><a href="#point-of-sales-pos" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Point of Sales (POS)</h3> <p>A point of purchase where customers execute payments for goods or services.</p> <h3 id="proof-of-authority-poa"><a href="#proof-of-authority-poa" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proof of Authority (PoA)</h3> <p>Proof-of-authority (PoA) is a consensus algorithm that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake. Proof of Authority (PoA) is a modified form of Proof of Stake (PoS) where instead of stake with the monetary value, a validator’s identity performs the role of stake.</p> <h3 id="proof-of-work-pow"><a href="#proof-of-work-pow" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proof of Work (PoW)</h3> <p>Proof of Work is a consensus algorithm which makes sure that all transactions on the network are validated by achieving consensus from the network. The algorithm is based on so-called 'nonces', which are mathematical (asymetric) puzzles, meaning it is (intentionally) difficult for miners to solve but the correct answer is easily verified by the network. PoW requires miners (validators) to spend an enormous amount of computing power in order to validate a set of transactions.</p> <h3 id="proof-of-stake-pos"><a href="#proof-of-stake-pos" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proof of Stake (PoS)</h3> <p>Like PoW, Proof of Stake is also a consensus algorithm to validate transactions, however, no mathematical puzzles are used. Instead,  the creator of a new block is chosen in a deterministic way based on their stake. A validator holds a &quot;stake&quot; in the network through a security-deposit. The higher the stake, the more chance the validator is selected. Consensus is reached by votes by the stakeholders, which receive a reward (fee) if they voted correctly.</p> <h3 id="sdk"><a href="#sdk" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> SDK</h3> <p>Software Development Kit. The OMG open-source, white-label SDK will be free for anyone to use and will make it easy for those who need online asset exchange as part of their business to connect seamlessly to the OMG Network. The SDK allows wallet providers the flexibility to enhance, add, and customize payment solutions for many use cases.</p> <h3 id="settlement-proof"><a href="#settlement-proof" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Settlement Proof</h3> <p>In the context of cryptocurrency, a settlement proof is a proof that a trade has been settled.</p> <h3 id="slashing-condition"><a href="#slashing-condition" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slashing condition</h3> <p>A condition which, if triggered by a validator, causes the validator's deposit to be destroyed.</p> <h3 id="staking"><a href="#staking" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Staking</h3> <p>Staking a token means bounding a token which means it is locked up in a smart contract for a specific period of time in order to help making the network secure (because your bounded tokens can be used for validating transactions). In return for the risk you take as a &quot;staker&quot; (locking tokens up and vouching for the network), the &quot;staker&quot; returns tokens or fees from the network.</p> <h3 id="stake"><a href="#stake" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Stake</h3> <p>Bonded tokens are “at stake” or at risk. Often times bonded tokens are called stake.</p> <h3 id="wallet-or-digital-wallet"><a href="#wallet-or-digital-wallet" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Wallet (or digital wallet)</h3> <p>Digital solution or service that allows an individual to make electronic transactions online.</p> <h3 id="white-label"><a href="#white-label" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> White-label</h3> <p>A white label product is a product or service produced by one company (the producer) that other companies (the marketers) rebrand to make it appear as if they had made it</p> <h2 id="plasma-scalability"><a href="#plasma-scalability" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma Scalability</h2> <h3 id="bonding"><a href="#bonding" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bonding</h3> <p>Bonding stake means you deposit some money into the network, and in some sense use it as a collateral to vouch for a block. Think of bonding as committing to the network long term. When you bond, your tokens are locked in for some period. In return, you earn tokens or fees from the network, growing your total ownership in the network. People who do not bond will have easy access to their tokens and liquidity, but their ownership in the network will decrease as new tokens are released that they won’t receive. While people who bond will give up immediate liquidity in exchange for growing their ownership in the network, and helping to make the network high quality and secure.</p> <h3 id="challenges"><a href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Challenges</h3> <p>An assert/challenge construction allows one to assert a particular state is correct. By having this assert/challenge-proof construction, interested participants can be able to assert ground truths to non-interested participants on the root blockchain.</p> <h3 id="child-chain"><a href="#child-chain" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Child chain</h3> <p>A Plamsa chain is often referred to as a child chain. A child chain is not to be mistaken with a sidechain. The core difference is that sidechains are ultimately reliant on their own consensus mechanism for security, whereas plasma chains are backed by the security of the main chain.</p> <h3 id="exit"><a href="#exit" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Exit</h3> <p>Plasma applications make use of state commitments whenever a user wants to leave the plasma chain. We usually refer to this as “exiting” the application.</p> <h3 id="fungible-token-ft"><a href="#fungible-token-ft" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fungible token (FT)</h3> <p>Cryptographic tokens whose individual units are essentially interchangeable. Bitcoin, ether and many other network or utility tokens are fungible in nature.</p> <h3 id="non-fungible-token-nft"><a href="#non-fungible-token-nft" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Non-fungible token (NFT)</h3> <p>Special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature.</p> <h3 id="off-chain-execution"><a href="#off-chain-execution" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Off-chain Execution</h3> <p>Plasma applications do a majority of their work outside of the “root chain” (e.g. Ethereum). Root chains tend to be slow and costly because they need to be very secure. If an application can do any work outside of the root blockchain, it should.</p> <h3 id="parent-chain-or-main-chain-root-chain"><a href="#parent-chain-or-main-chain-root-chain" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Parent chain (or main chain / root chain)</h3> <p>Smart contracts are created on the Ethereum main chain that act as the “root” of the Plasma child chains.</p> <h3 id="plasma-2"><a href="#plasma-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma</h3> <p>Plasma is a framework for building scalable applications.</p> <h3 id="plasma-mvp"><a href="#plasma-mvp" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma MVP</h3> <p>Minimal Viable Plasma is a design for an extremely simple UTXO-based plasma chain. It relies on confirmation signatures because withdrawals are processed in order based on the position of the output being withdrawn.</p> <h3 id="plasma-morevp"><a href="#plasma-morevp" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma MoreVP</h3> <p>More Viable Plasma, also known as MoreVP, is an extension to Minimal Viable Plasma that removes the need for confirmation signatures. MoreVP modifies the process through which users can withdraw their funds. The ordering of each withdrawal becomes based on the position of the <em>youngest input</em> to the transaction that created an output.</p> <h3 id="plasma-cash"><a href="#plasma-cash" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma Cash</h3> <p>Plasma Cash is a plasma design primarily built for storing and transferring non-fungible tokens. Plasma Cash was originally designed to address the mass exit problem in Plasma MVP. The design of Plasma Cash ensures that user funds are always safe, even if the consensus mechanism misbehaves.</p> <h3 id="plasma-debit"><a href="#plasma-debit" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma Debit</h3> <p>Plasma Debit is like Plasma Cash, except every token is a payment channel between the user and the chain operator. It’s sort of like a big Lightning hub, but the channels can be transferred just like a Plasma Cash token. Because of the way it makes use of payment channels, Plasma Debit is more suited for single operators than for lots of validators.</p> <h3 id="plasma-xt"><a href="#plasma-xt" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plasma XT</h3> <p>Introduces checkpointing from the plasma chain to the root chain, which allows for periodic finalization of a coin’s ownership in order to reduce the amount of data which must be stored and verified by each user to limit the storage and computation requirements per coin.</p> <h3 id="signature"><a href="#signature" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Signature</h3> <p>In blockchain transactions, a signature is included in a message based on the sender's private key, so that the recipient can verify the transaction using the sender's public key (see assymmetric encryption).</p> <h3 id="state-commitment"><a href="#state-commitment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> State commitment</h3> <p>Because Plasma is working off-chain, there is a need to make sure that changes are final. This is why Plasma makes uses of so-called “state commitments.” A state commitment is a cryptographic way to store a compressed version of the state of your application.</p> <h3 id="state-updates"><a href="#state-updates" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> State updates</h3> <p>A kind of evidence that proves the current state of a chain</p> <h3 id="unbounding"><a href="#unbounding" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Unbounding</h3> <p>If you have bonded your token, and you would like to withdraw, then you can do so, but you have to wait some period of time before being able to unbond and withdraw (possibly weeks or months), they are necessarily aligned with the long term success and usefulness of the network.</p> <h3 id="utxo"><a href="#utxo" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> UTXO</h3> <p>Unspent Transaction Output that can be spent as an input in a new transaction. Bitcoin is the most famous example of a cryptocurrency that uses the UTXO model. The requirement exists that only unspent outputs may be used in further transactions to prevent double spending and fraud. For this reason, inputs on a blockchain are deleted when a transaction occurs, whilst at the same time, outputs are created in the form of UTXOs. These unspent transaction outputs may be used (by the holders of private keys; for example, persons with cryptocurrency wallets) for the purpose of future transactions. Plasma MVP is an example of a simple UTXO-based plasma chain.</p> <h2 id="network-lifecycle"><a href="#network-lifecycle" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Network Lifecycle</h2> <p><em>The OmiseGO team is working in several milestones to deliver a first release of the OMG Network to the community.</em></p> <h3 id="honte"><a href="#honte" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Honte</h3> <p>Early 2018, OmiseGO have been working closely with the Tendermint team in developing their Honte milestone. Honte was meant to be a Tendermint chain with staking and sufficient transaction throughput to support the initial implementation of the OMG DEX. Once Plasma reached an equivalent stage of development, they would shift from Tendermint onto Plasma. The development was diverted to Cosmos though and OmiseGO immediately moved on working on Tesusji Plasma.</p> <h3 id="tesuji-plasma"><a href="#tesuji-plasma" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tesuji Plasma</h3> <p>The first iteration of OmiseGO plasma-based implementation.
